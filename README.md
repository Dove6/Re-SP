Starting from the very beginning of the game series, this project targets porting *Reksio i Skarb Pirat√≥w* to the most recent version of its 2D engine available: BlooMoo Engine 1.0.8 developed by Aidem Media in 2006. Despite being 14 years old, it should operate way better than its predecessor PiKlib8 (used in the latest official release of the game), not to mention other benefits of unifying all games providing one common exe/dll pair.

Aside from that main task, the repository also provides fixes to various in-game bugs, e.g. missing animations, illogical event sequences and more.

## Download
Soon here: [releases](https://github.com/Dove6/Re-SP/releases)  
Note that the game engine is Windows-only and 32-bit (x86 arch).
